# üöÄ Railway Deployment Fix - Afelu Guardian

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Server Route Issue**

- **Problem**: Express route patterns with `/*` were causing path-to-regexp errors
- **Fix**: Simplified routing to use basic patterns and static file serving

### 2. **Homepage Serving**

- **Problem**: No explicit root route handler for homepage
- **Fix**: Added `app.get('/', ...)` route to serve index.html

### 3. **Railway Configuration**

- **Added**: `railway.json` with proper build and deploy configuration
- **Added**: Health check endpoint at `/api/health`

## üîß **Deployment Steps for Railway**

### Step 1: Push Latest Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve homepage routing and Railway deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Railway dashboard:

**Essential Variables:**

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (already configured)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

**Optional but Recommended:**

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DOMAIN=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Verify Database Migration

Railway should automatically run:

```bash
npm run build  # This runs: npm run db:generate && npm run db:push
```

### Step 4: Test Deployment

1. Check the Railway logs for successful startup
2. Visit your Railway app URL
3. Verify homepage loads correctly
4. Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`

## üéØ **What's Working Now**

### ‚úÖ **Homepage Loading**

- Root route properly serves `/public/index.html`
- Static files served from `/public` directory

- Status check: `/api/status`
- Stripe webhooks: `/api/stripe-webhook`

### ‚úÖ **Telegram Bot**

- Bot starts after 2-second delay
- Polling mode for development
- Webhook mode ready for production

### ‚úÖ **Database**

## üêõ **Troubleshooting Railway Issues**

### Issue: "Application failed to respond"

**Solution:**

1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify PORT environment variable is set
3. Ensure health check endpoint responds

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:**

1. Verify DATABASE_URL in Railway dashboard
2. Check if database service is running
3. Run manual migration: `npx prisma db push`

### Issue: "Bot not responding"

**Solution:**

1. Verify TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is correct
2. Set webhook URL in Railway:

   ```bash
   TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.railway.app/webhook
   ```

### Issue: "Stripe webhooks failing"

**Solution:**

1. Update Stripe webhook endpoint to your Railway URL
2. Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Stripe dashboard

## üìä **Railway Monitoring**

### Check These Metrics

- **CPU Usage**: Should be < 50% normally
- **Memory Usage**: Should be < 512MB normally  
- **Response Time**: Should be < 500ms for homepage
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%

### Log Monitoring

Look for these success messages:

```
‚úÖ OpenAI service configured
Afelu Guardian web server is running on http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ Bot polling started
‚úÖ Bot commands registered with Telegram
```

## üéâ **Your Railway App is Ready!**

Your Afelu Guardian platform should now:

- ‚úÖ Load the homepage correctly on Railway
- ‚úÖ Handle database connections
