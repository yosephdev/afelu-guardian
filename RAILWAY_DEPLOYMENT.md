# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide for Afelu Guardian

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Railway is Perfect for Your Project

Railway will handle everything automatically:

- âœ… **PostgreSQL database** (no setup needed)
- âœ… **HTTPS certificates** (automatic)
- âœ… **Environment variables** (web UI management)
- âœ… **GitHub integration** (auto-deploy on push)
- âœ… **Logs and monitoring** (built-in)

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Environment Variables

Create a `.env.production` file with these values:

```bash
# Production Environment
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Database (Railway will auto-provide this)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (automatically set by Railway)

# Telegram Bot
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_production_bot_token
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app/webhook

# AI Services
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_fallback_key

# Stripe (USE LIVE KEYS FOR PRODUCTION)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Email Service
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-production-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-string
DOMAIN=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)** and sign up with GitHub

2. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**

3. **Select your `afelu-guardian` repository**

4. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Node.js project
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Set up the environment

5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Click "Variables" tab
   - Add all the variables from `.env.production` above
   - **Don't add DATABASE_URL** - Railway provides this automatically

6. **Deploy automatically!**
   - Railway will build and deploy your app
   - You'll get a URL like `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### 3. Post-Deployment Setup

#### Update Telegram Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://your-app-name.railway.app/webhook"}'
```

#### Update Stripe Webhooks

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Update your webhook URL to: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/stripe/webhook`
3. Make sure these events are selected:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`

#### Run Database Migrations

Railway will automatically run `npm install`, but you might need to run:

```bash
# Railway should handle this, but if needed:
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Verify Everything Works

âœ… **Test your website**: Visit `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
âœ… **Test Telegram bot**: Send `/start` to your bot
âœ… **Test payments**: Try buying a plan (use test mode first)
âœ… **Check database**: Verify data is being stored
